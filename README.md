# TEMU助手 (Modified)

This is a modified version of the TEMU助手 browser extension.

## Original Purpose

The original TEMU助手 extension was designed to automate tasks and improve productivity for users of e-commerce platforms such as TEMU, AliExpress, Amazon, and SHEIN. Its features likely included tools for order management, product research, and other seller-related activities.

## Modifications

This version of the extension has been modified to remove login verifications and usage restrictions that may have been present in the original version. The goal of these modifications is to allow users to access the extension's functionalities without needing to authenticate or worry about limitations.

**Disclaimer:** Modifying browser extensions and bypassing restrictions may have security implications or violate terms of service. Use this modified extension at your own risk.

## How to Load and Use

1.  **Download the modified extension files.**
    *   You should have a folder containing the modified extension files, including `manifest.json`, `background.js`, and other necessary resources.
2.  **Open your browser's extension management page.**
    *   In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
    *   In Edge, navigate to `edge://extensions`.
    *   For other browsers, find the equivalent page for managing extensions.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode.**
    *   Look for a toggle or checkbox labeled "Developer mode" and enable it. This will allow you to load unpacked extensions.
4.  **Load the unpacked extension.**
    *   Click on the "Load unpacked" button.
    *   Select the folder containing the modified extension files.
5.  **Using the Extension.**
    *   Once loaded, the extension should be active. You can usually access its features through an icon in your browser's toolbar or by interacting with the websites it supports.
    *   Since the login and usage restrictions have been removed, you should be able to use its features without any prompts for authentication.

## Files Modified

*   `background.js`: Analyzed for potential login/restriction mechanisms. Further modifications may be needed if issues are encountered.
*   Other files related to specific platform interactions may have been implicitly affected by changes to `background.js`.

**Note:** The analysis of `background.js` is ongoing. If you encounter any issues or remaining restrictions, further investigation and modification of `background.js` may be required.
